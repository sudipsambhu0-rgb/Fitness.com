This is a simple and beginner-friendly fitness website built using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to provide users with
basic workout guidance and exercise-related information in a clean and
easy-to-use interface.

Our website includes multiple exercise pages such as push-ups, squats,
plank, and other bodyweight workouts. Each exercise page explains what the
exercise is, how it helps the body, and how users can perform it properly.
Some pages also include basic interactive features like timers to help
users track their workout duration.

The project also contains important pages such as a Privacy Policy and a
Contact page to make the website more professional and trustworthy. Our
website does not collect, store, or share any personal user data. All
information provided is for general fitness and educational purposes only.

Our website is hosted using GitHub Pages and Netlify, making it accessible
on both desktop and mobile devices. The design follows a minimal dark theme
with accent colors to create a modern and focused gym-style experience.

This project was created for learning and practice purposes, helping improve
web development skills and understanding how real-world websites are built,
structured, and deployed online.

Note: Our website does not provide any 100% guarantee of fitness results.
Outcomes depend on individual effort, consistency, and physical condition.
